    <h1>Poached Eggs Caprese</h1>
    <p>These poached caprese eggs are a delicious dish inspired by eggs Benedict with mozzarella, tomatoes, and pesto.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches water and bring to a boil over high heat. <br>
            Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar and 2 teaspoons salt, and keep water at a gentle simmer. </li>
        <li> While waiting for water to simmer, place 1 mozzarella cheese slice and 1 tomato slice onto each English muffin half. <br>
            Cook in a toaster oven until cheese softens and English muffin has toasted, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li> Crack an egg into a small bowl. Holding the bowl just above water's surface, gently slip egg into simmering water. Repeat with remaining eggs. <br>
            Poach eggs until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 to 3 minutes. <br>
            Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon and dab them on a kitchen towel to remove excess water. </li>
        <li> To assemble, place a poached egg on top of each English muffin. <br>
            Spoon 1 teaspoon pesto sauce onto each egg and sprinkle with salt. </li>
    </ul>
