    <p>How Ricotta and Cottage Cheese Are the Same (and Different)</p>
    <p>So, if you’ve always used ricotta cheese in your lasagna recipes, why make the switch? <br>
        For one, cottage cheese’s light texture is the ideal complement to the acidic tomato sauce and tender noodles in baked pasta dishes. <br>
        Many cooks find the texture of cottage cheese to be less dry and chalky than ricotta. <br>
        The improvement in texture is especially noticeable when reheating leftovers (and honestly aren’t leftovers the best part of making an extra-large tray of lasagna?). <br>
        Plus, cottage cheese is a bit higher in protein and lower in fat, so if you’re looking to increase the nutrient profile of your lasagna, this swap could be an easy way to do it. <br>

    <p>Both cheeses are commonly found in almost all grocery stores, but sometimes ricotta cheese isn’t available or out of stock. </p>
        In that case, cottage cheese can be a real dinner lifesaver. If you have a favorite lasagne, stuffed shell, or baked manicotti recipe, <br>
        you can easily use cottage cheese as a 1:1 swap. So, if the recipe calls for 16 ounces of ricotta, use the same amount of cottage cheese.<br>
        
    <p>Pro tip: For the creamiest texture, choose cottage cheese with small curds instead of large and opt for the full-fat version. <br>
        Additionally, cottage cheese is a bit saltier than ricotta, so you may need to decrease the salt in your recipe a tad. </p>
        
    <p>If you’re not quite ready to say goodbye to ricotta, you could experiment with using a mix of both cheeses. <br>
        But if you’re intrigued by the idea of creamy lasagne that reheats beautifully, give cottage cheese a try.</p>
